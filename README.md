#### Featured
* Interactive Grid
  * Visually observe the evolution of life patterns on a customizable grid, witnessing how simple rules give rise to complex structures.
* Frame-by-Frame Simulation
  * Step through the simulation frame by frame, allowing precise control and analysis of pattern evolution with the ability to move forward or backward in time.
#### Coming Soon
* Mobile Interactivity
  * Supports mobile-friendly interactions, ensuring a seamless and engaging experience on smartphones and tablets.
* Customizable Simulation
  * Adjust the speed of the simulation to observe patterns evolve at your preferred pace, from slow-motion analysis to high-speed demonstrations.
* Pattern Library
  * Access a curated selection of classic Game of Life patterns, instantly loading them onto the grid for experimentation.
* State Persistence
  * Preserve your simulation progress using browser cache, seamlessly resuming from where you left off even after closing the application.
* Optimized Performance
  * Separates the UI thread from the simulation logic using Web Workers, ensuring smooth and responsive interactions even during complex computations.
